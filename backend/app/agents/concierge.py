"""Helpdesk concierge agent.

Phase 0: a plain concierge backed by the Foundry model.
Phase 1: when a Foundry IQ knowledge base is configured, attach an
AzureAISearchContextProvider in agentic mode so the agent grounds its answers in
the runbook corpus and cites sources (and says "I don't know" off-corpus).

If the knowledge base settings are absent (not yet provisioned/ingested), the
agent falls back to the Phase 0 behavior so the app still boots.

APIs verified against agent-framework 1.9.0 / agent-framework-azure-ai-search.
