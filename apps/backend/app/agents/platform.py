"""Platform/ops domain — a TOOL-driven agent (not KB-grounded).

Unlike the grounded experts (cockpit/selfwiki), this agent's capability is the set of
Microsoft first-party MCP tools assembled per-request from app/agents/mcp/. Tools are
role-filtered (Reader sees reads, Author/Admin see writes) and, for OBO servers, run as the
signed-in user. The /platform endpoint requires sign-in; the per-request tool build reads the
caller's roles + OBO credential from the request context (set by the auth dependency).

APIs mirror app/agents/selfwiki.py (agent-framework 1.9.0).

    """A `SupportsAgentRun` proxy that REBUILDS the platform agent on every call, so each
    request gets tools filtered by the CURRENT caller's roles + OBO credential (read from the
    request-context contextvar set by the auth dependency).

    Why this exists: `add_agent_framework_fastapi_endpoint(agent=...)` wants a
    `SupportsAgentRun` *instance*, not a factory function. The grounded domains build once at
    boot under `DefaultAzureCredential` — we can't, because the whole point of this agent is
    per-request identity/role filtering. The helpdesk path solves the same problem with a
    `Workflow` subclass factory; a single agent needs this lighter proxy instead.

    `SupportsAgentRun` is a `@runtime_checkable` Protocol whose members are
    `run`/`create_session`/`get_session` AND the data attributes `id`/`name`/`description`
    — `isinstance` enforces the attributes too, so the three methods ALONE fail the check and
    registration raises `TypeError`. Hence the class attributes below. The `run` delegation is
    the live path; `create_session`/`get_session` exist only to satisfy the protocol (the AG-UI
    adapter builds its own `AgentSession` and never calls them on the default
    `use_service_session=False` path), so they delegate but carry no session state.
