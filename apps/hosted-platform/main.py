# Hosted-platform entrypoint (D-packaging, Phase 1 — Hosted).
#
# Packages the engineering-platform concierge (the TOOL-driven agent, app/agents/platform.py)
# as a Foundry *hosted agent*: a container that serves the **Invocations** protocol on port
# 8088, invoked through the Foundry gateway. agent-framework-foundry-hosting's
# InvocationsHostServer is the bridge — it serves the agent over the Invocations (raw AG-UI)
# protocol so write-approval interrupts can round-trip on the hosted path (which the Responses
# protocol the grounded twins use cannot do).
#
# This is the FULL-PARITY Invocations twin of the live platform agent — NOT the single-identity
# Responses stripping the grounded hosted-agent/hosted-cockpit do. The grounded twins drop
# OBO/memory/HITL because pure Q&A fits a single-identity request/response model; the platform
# concierge instead keeps its tool capability and its write-approval interrupt, which is exactly
# why it serves Invocations rather than Responses.
#
# Tools are NOT built here per-request (that's the live OBO path, build_mcp_tools()). For a
# hosted agent, tools are configured ON the Foundry Toolbox at DEPLOY time and the agent resolves
# them through the Toolbox referenced by TOOLBOX_NAME (ADR-011): OAuth identity passthrough
# is DATA on the Toolbox/connection, never hand-rolled credential code here. Auth is the
# platform-injected agent identity via DefaultAzureCredential; config comes from env (declared in
# agent.yaml / injected by the platform). as_agent(...) is verified against agent-framework 1.9.0.
