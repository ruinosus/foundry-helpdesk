"""The helpdesk workflow: triage -> retrieve -> resolve, built per request.

Phase 3 makes the workflow per-request so each run uses the *signed-in user's*
On-Behalf-Of credential (Foundry, KB, and memory called as that user) and their
own memory scope. The AG-UI workflow factory receives only a thread_id, so the
user identity comes from the request-scoped contextvar set by the auth dependency
(see app.auth).

When auth is disabled, credential_for_request() falls back to
DefaultAzureCredential and memory_scope() to a dev scope, so this also works
locally without Entra.

WorkflowBuilder API verified against agent-framework 1.9.0.
