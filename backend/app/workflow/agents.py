"""The three workflow agents: triage -> retrieve -> resolve.

Each agent is a Foundry-backed ChatAgent. Their `name` becomes the workflow
executor id, which the AG-UI adapter emits as the step name the frontend renders
(verified: resolve_agent_id falls back to agent.name). So names are lowercase,
UI-facing: "triage", "retrieve", "resolve".

The chain passes each agent's output to the next, so instructions are written so
every step's output is self-contained for the step that follows.
