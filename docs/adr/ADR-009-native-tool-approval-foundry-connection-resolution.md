# ADR-009 — Native tool-approval + Foundry-connection credential resolution (no self-read Key Vault, no hand-rolled HITL)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-29
- **Context spec:** [Sub-project C](../superpowers/specs/2026-06-29-subproject-c-credential-brokering-design.md) · builds on [ADR-005](./ADR-005-never-store-secrets.md), [ADR-008](./ADR-008-foundry-connections-app-configuration.md)

## Context

Sub-project C brokers credentials for the platform agent's MCP tools and gates write tools with
human approval. An early design had us **read the customer's Key Vault secret ourselves and inject
it as a header** (the `keyvault_ref` path) and **wrap the platform agent in a custom workflow** to
get a write-approval step. Researching against Microsoft showed both **reinvent first-party
mechanisms** — the same lesson as ADR-008.

## Decision

Use the Microsoft-native mechanisms; build neither a secret reader nor a custom HITL.

- **Credential resolution → Foundry connections + OBO; we never read a Key Vault secret.**
  - **OBO** (Microsoft-audience servers: Azure, Azure DevOps, Entra) — mint the user's
    On-Behalf-Of token on the internal path. No reference, no stored secret.
  - **Foundry connection** (everything non-OBO, e.g. GitHub) — the credential lives in a Foundry
    connection (ApiKey / Key Vault / Entra), referenced by `Connection.foundry_connection_id`.
    *Hosted path:* `get_mcp_tool(project_connection_id=...)` — Foundry resolves it. *Internal path:*
    retrieve the connection's credential via `azure-ai-projects` **at runtime** (Foundry is the
    store; we broker in memory, never persist). Microsoft: *"your agent definition never contains
    the actual secret values — only template references… the platform resolves them."*
  - **`keyvault_ref` is deprecated** (it implied we read the Key Vault) in favor of
    `foundry_connection_id` — the build stops reading it; the field stays on `Connection` for
    back-compat with existing records. No `azure-keyvault-secrets` dependency.
- **Write approval → the framework's native tool-approval, not a custom workflow.**
  Set per-tool `approval_mode="always_require"` on write tools; the framework pauses and emits a
  `RequestInfoEvent` carrying `ToolApprovalRequestContent`. The existing approval card
  (`components/chat/TicketApproval.tsx`, which taps the raw `request_info` CUSTOM event and resumes
  via `agent.runAgent({ resume })` — CopilotKit's native interrupt detection doesn't match the
  framework interrupt) is **extended** to carry `ToolApprovalRequestContent`; approval requires the
  **Approver/Admin** role (project rule #5). The AG-UI bug agent-framework #3199 (always_require not
  executing over AG-UI) is a **verification item** with **two independent checks**: (a) is #3199
  fixed in the installed version, so `always_require` actually fires over AG-UI? and (b) does the
  native approval surface as the same `request_info`-style CUSTOM event the existing tap consumes?
  If (a) fails → fallback to a framework `RequestInfoEvent`-emitting middleware (still not a
  hand-rolled workflow). If (b) fails → the frontend resume-bridge handling is scoped as real work
  (a new event shape + card path), not a one-line extension.

## Consequences

- **+** We never read or store a customer secret — the secret boundary ([ADR-005](./ADR-005-never-store-secrets.md)) holds at runtime, not just at rest.
- **+** Much less custom code: no KV client, no `azure-keyvault-secrets`, no custom approval workflow — the framework + Foundry provide both.
- **+** Aligned with the Microsoft macro (Foundry connections as identity broker + native tool-approval HITL).
- **−** Non-OBO services on the **internal** path depend on `azure-ai-projects` exposing a get-connection-with-credentials call (verify the signature; don't invent it). If unavailable, non-OBO is hosted-only.
- **−** The write-approval over AG-UI depends on #3199 being fixed (or the middleware fallback).

## Alternatives considered

- **Self-read Key Vault + inject header** — makes us a secret handler, reinvents Foundry connections; rejected.
- **Custom workflow-as-agent with a `request_info` approval node** — reinvents the native tool-approval; rejected.
