"""Escalation step — human-in-the-loop ticket approval (Phase 4).

This is the final node of the workflow. If the resolve agent flagged that a
ticket is needed (its answer is exactly "TICKET: <summary>"), this executor
pauses the workflow with ctx.request_info() and waits for the developer's
decision. The ticket is created ONLY in the response handler, after approval —
so "no ticket without approval" holds structurally.

Why a workflow request_info node instead of an approval-mode tool on the agent:
the AG-UI workflow adapter (agent-framework-ag-ui 1.0.0rc5) duplicates the
TOOL_CALL_START for an agent's approval-gated tool call, breaking the stream. The
native workflow request/response mechanism emits a clean request_info interrupt
that CopilotKit renders via useInterrupt. (This also matches the spec's original
triage -> retrieve -> resolve -> escalate design.)

APIs verified against agent-framework 1.9.0.
