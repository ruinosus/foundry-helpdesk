"""Per-user Foundry memory (Phase 3).

FoundryMemoryProvider is a context provider: before a run it searches the user's
memories (preferences, past resolutions) and injects them; after the run it
stores new memories. Scoping by the authenticated user's object id isolates each
developer's memory — the primary defense against memory poisoning.

API verified against agent-framework foundry: FoundryMemoryProvider(
project_endpoint, credential, memory_store_name, scope, update_delay).
