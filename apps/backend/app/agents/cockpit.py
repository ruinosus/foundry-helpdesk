"""Cockpit expert agent — a second domain alongside the helpdesk.

Same Foundry IQ pattern as the concierge, pointed at the **cockpit-kb** (the Cockpit
platform docs ingested by app/knowledge/ingest_cockpit.py). Pure grounded Q&A — no
workflow steps or ticket escalation; the Cockpit corpus is reference knowledge.

Grounding is Microsoft's documented Foundry IQ pattern: the AzureAISearchContextProvider
(agentic retrieval) injects the relevant Cockpit docs — with citations — into context,
and the answering discipline lives in COCKPIT_INSTRUCTIONS. No consume-side Agent Skill:
the KB *is* the knowledge, so a retrieval-discipline skill (and its read_skill_resource
tool) only added noise. Wiki *generation* still uses the deep-wiki skills.

The Cockpit KB is org-wide (not per-user), so this runs under the app's own identity
(DefaultAzureCredential), not OBO. The /cockpit endpoint still requires sign-in.
